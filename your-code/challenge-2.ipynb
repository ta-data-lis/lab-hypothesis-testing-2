The difference between t-test and ANOVA is the former is ued to compare two groups whereas the latter is used to compare three or more groups. [Read more about the difference between t-test and ANOVA](http://b.link/anova24).\n","\n","From the ANOVA test, you receive two numbers. The first number is called the **F-value** which indicates whether your null-hypothesis can be rejected. The critical F-value that rejects the null-hypothesis varies according to the number of total subjects and the number of subject groups in your experiment. In [this table](http://b.link/eda14) you can find the critical values of the F distribution. **If you are confused by the massive F-distribution table, don't worry. Skip F-value for now and study it at a later time. In this challenge you only need to look at the p-value.**\n","\n","The p-value is another number yielded by ANOVA which already takes the number of total subjects and the number of experiment groups into consideration. **Typically if your p-value is less than 0.05, you can declare the null-hypothesis is rejected.**\n","\n","In this challenge, we want to understand whether there are significant differences among various types of pokemons' `Total` value, i.e. Grass vs Poison vs Fire vs Dragon... There are many types of pokemons which makes it a perfect use case for ANOVA."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Auc0EWH3vn4u","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1638392398410,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":871,"user":{"displayName":"stanley rocha","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjMNY_lsTff3Cyv6WkVaji2_h6SnUl2XjcVhvzdaEM=s64","userId":"00951066335831658539"}}},"source":["# Import libraries\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import scipy.stats as st"],"execution_count":8,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ww1fBP-Dvn4w","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1638392400043,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":247,"user":{"displayName":"stanley rocha","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjMNY_lsTff3Cyv6WkVaji2_h6SnUl2XjcVhvzdaEM=s64","userId":"00951066335831658539"}},"outputId":"5d54f01d-7ba4-42a4-9078-a981646c55f2"},"source":["# Load the data:\n","pokemon= pd.read_csv('/content/Pokemon.csv')\n","\n","pokemon.head()\n"],"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>#</th>\n","      <th>Name</th>\n","      <th>Type 1</th>\n","      <th>Type 2</th>\n","      <th>Total</th>\n","      <th>HP</th>\n","      <th>Attack</th>\n","      <th>Defense</th>\n","      <th>Sp.
