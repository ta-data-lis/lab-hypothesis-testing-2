    "# Challenge 2 - ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)** is also used to analyze the differences among group means. The difference between t-test and ANOVA is the former is ued to compare two groups whereas the latter is used to compare three or more groups. [Read more about the difference between t-test and ANOVA](http://b.link/anova24).\n",
    "\n",
    "From the ANOVA test, you receive two numbers. The first number is called the **F-value** which indicates whether your null-hypothesis can be rejected. The critical F-value that rejects the null-hypothesis varies according to the number of total subjects and the number of subject groups in your experiment. In [this table](http://b.link/eda14) you can find the critical values of the F distribution. **If you are confused by the massive F-distribution table, don't worry. Skip F-value for now and study it at a later time. In this challenge you only need to look at the p-value.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value is another number yielded by ANOVA which already takes the number of total subjects and the number of experiment groups into consideration. **Typically if your p-value is less than 0.05, you can declare the null-hypothesis is rejected.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, we want to understand whether there are significant differences among various types of pokemons' `Total` value, i.e. Grass vs Poison vs Fire vs Dragon... There are many types of pokemons which makes it a perfect use case for ANOVA."
